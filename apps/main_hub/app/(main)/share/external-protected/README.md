## Security and Privacy

Ensuring the security and privacy of user data is a top priority for FreeShare. By adopting Firebase as the storage and database solution, FreeShare leverages Firebase's robust security measures, including encryption in transit and at rest, to safeguard user files from unauthorized access.

The unique 5-digit PIN assigned to each file ensures that only those who possess the PIN can access the shared files. This PIN-based system adds an extra layer of security and prevents unauthorized downloads.

Furthermore, FreeShare's no-registration policy means that users do not need to provide any personal information, such as email, phone number, or name, further safeguarding their privacy.

2. **User Feedback**: Collecting user feedback to continuously improve the platform's user experience and address any potential issues.

3. **File Preview**: Implementing a file preview feature to allow users to view certain file types directly on the platform without the need for downloading.

4. **User Accounts (Optional)**: Introducing optional user accounts for users who prefer to keep track of their shared files and manage them in a personalized dashboard.
